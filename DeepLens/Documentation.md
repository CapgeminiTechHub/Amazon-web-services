Jakir Ashraf and Luke Power had the task of building a Deeplens project which counted the number of people in a room. 
This would work by identifying faces in a room and incrementing/decrementing the counter when people arrive and leave the room.
This file will document our progress through building this skill in hope that we could help others save time by learning from our mistakes and problems we ran into.

Note, the login details for the DeepLens device is:
Username = Deepcam
Password = TechHub99#

# Week 1 to Week 3

Firstly, we set up the deeplens device. We went onto the AWS Deeplens section and attempted to register our brand new Deeplens device.
As we were going through the setup, we faced a problem. On AWS DeepLens, our devices 'Registration status' was 'Awaiting credentials' and was on this status for a while. We realised there must have been a problem with our device as we waited a while for the status to change but it never did. We reset the devices multiple times and tried again, yet this still did not fix our issue.

We changed the Wi-Fi a few times and started using a wired connection, eventually we tried a Mobile hotspot and re-registered the device and this worked. However, it was only a short term solution, as you may know, streaming live video over mobile data is very resource intensive and would use up out limited data very quickly.

After a lot of discussion on how we could find anoterh way to register the device, we spoke to Les about the problem we were facing. Les recommended that we speak to Jamie Gibbs. Jamie had previous experience with the DeepLens device and was sucessful in setting the device up
